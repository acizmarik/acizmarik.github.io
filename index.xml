Currently, I work as a freelance Software Engineer.
Prior to that, I graduated from Computer Science Master&amp;rsquo;s programme at Charles Univesity, specializing in distributed and reliable systems.
I work primarily on the .NET platform. Other than that, I like to use C++ for low-level projects and bash for scripting. Regardless, I enjoy learning and exploring new things and understanding systems that I work with to their core.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://acizmarik.com/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://acizmarik.com/projects/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
