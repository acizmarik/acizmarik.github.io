## Hello {{% emoji ":wave:" %}}, 

I am Andrej Čižmárik. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Veeam Software.

Prior to that, I worked as a Software Engineer at RIGANTI. I was one of the core developers for the DotVVM framework - I worked mainly on its binding compiler, runtime code generation, javascript transpiler, validation system, custom Roslyn Analyzers and DotVVM's Visual Studio Extension. Other than that, I also participated in a few client projects within the .NET ecosystem.

I graduated from [Computer Science Master's programme](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en) at Charles Univesity, specializing in distributed and reliable systems.

## Interests

I work primarily on the .NET platform. Other than that, I like to use C++ for low-level projects and bash for scripting. Regardless, I enjoy learning and exploring new things and understanding systems that I work with to their core.

Right now, I am mainly interested in the system-oriented programming, distributed systems, tools for code generation / code analysis. Other than that I enjoy working with microcontrollers and learning about hardware and electronics.
