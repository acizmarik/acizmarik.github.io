## Hello {{< emoji ":wave:" >}}, 

I am Andrej Čižmárik. Currently, I work as a freelance Software Engineer.  

Prior to that, I graduated from [Computer Science Master's programme](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en) at Charles Univesity, specializing in distributed and reliable systems.

I work primarily on the .NET platform. Other than that, I like to use C++ for low-level projects and bash for scripting. Regardless, I enjoy learning and exploring new things and understanding systems that I work with to their core.

## Interests

Right now, I am mainly interested in the system-oriented programming, distributed systems, tools for code generation / code analysis. Other than that I enjoy working with microcontrollers and learning about hardware and electronics.

## Projects

If you are curious about projects I worked on, feel free to visit my [Projects](/projects) page. Alternatively, you can also view my [GitHub page](https://github.com/acizmarik), or my [GitLab page](https://gitlab.com/acizmarik) profiles.
